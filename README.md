# Customer-Segmentation-using-Pyspark
This project focuses on customer segmentation and recommendation systems using PySpark, a powerful tool for distributed data processing and big data analytics. The objective is to analyze customer behavior, group them into meaningful segments, and build recommendation models to deliver personalized product or service suggestions.
# Technologies Used:
Python: Core language for building and executing the PySpark workflows.
PySpark: For distributed data processing, analytics, and machine learning on big data.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation before processing with PySpark.
Spark ML: To build machine learning models and perform clustering (used in segmentation) and recommendation algorithms.
Big Data Analytics: Techniques used for handling large datasets efficiently.
# Key Steps in the Project:
Data Exploration: Clean, transform, and explore customer data to gain actionable insights.
Customer Segmentation: Use clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN) to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographic, and other features.
Recommendation System: Build personalized recommendation models using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
Evaluation: Validate the segmentation and recommendation systems using appropriate metrics like precision, recall, and recall-at-k.
# Technologies and Skills Involved:
PySpark for distributed computing and big data processing.
Machine Learning models using Spark MLlib (collaborative filtering, clustering algorithms).
Data Manipulation using PySpark DataFrames.
Big Data Tools: Handling large-scale customer data efficiently.
Model Training and Tuning: Building and fine-tuning recommendation models.
